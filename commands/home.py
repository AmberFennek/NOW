    """
    Takes you to your home, if you have one. If you're already home,
    takes you to your home room. home/set will show you where your
    home is set, or provide a what and where to set its home.
    home/here will set your home here, if the location allows it.
    Usage:
      home[/option]
      sweep <object>
      abode
    Options:
    /set <obj> [=||to home_location]  views or sets <obj>'s home location.
    /sweep <obj>  send obj home. (same as using sweep command)
    /here  sets current character's home to current location (same as abode command)
    /room  returns a character to its home room (same as room command)
    
    The "home" location is a "safety" location for objects; they will be
    moved there if their current location ceases to exist. All objects
    should always have a home location for this reason.
    It is also a convenient target of the "home" command.
